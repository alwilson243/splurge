Problems with Heroku can be caused by not running

  heroku run rake db:migrate
  
which updates the heroku/production/postgres database with local/sqlite3 changes. Another tip I read is to precompile assets locally
if the custom CSS is taking too long to load. This can be done by running

  RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
  git push heroku master
  heroku open
